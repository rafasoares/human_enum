# HumanEnum

This gem allows you to specify enum value translations in your I18n locale files like any other ActiveRecord attribute and adds helper methods to get humanized translations of enum values.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'human_enum'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install human_enum

## Usage

First, include the concern in your models:

```ruby
class MyModel < ApplicationRecord
  include HumanEnum
end
```

Alternativelly, add it to your `ApplicationRecord` to add the functionality to every model in your application:

```ruby
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  include HumanEnum
end
```

Declare your enums as you normally would:

```ruby
class MyModel < ApplicationRecord
  enum model_type: [:default, :special]
end
```

And add the enum values to your locale files under the pluralized version of the enum attribute:

```yaml
en:
  activerecord:
    attributes:
      my_model:
        model_types:
          default: Default Type
          special: I am so special
```

Then, you can use the helper method `human_[enum_attribute_name]` whenever you need the translated / humanized version of the enum value:

```ruby
model = MyModel.new model_type: :special
puts model.human_model_type # "I am so special"
```

To get the translated list of all possible enum values (as a Hash), use the class method `human_[pluralized_enum_attribute_name]`:

```ruby
puts MyModel.human_model_types # "{default: 'Default Type', special: 'I am so special'}"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
